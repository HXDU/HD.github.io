I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.wwu.edu/) with a joint appointment at Science, Math, and Technology Education ([SMATE](https://smate.wwu.edu/)). 

I conducted interdisciplinary research at the intersections of Computer Science, learning sciences, and educational technologies. The key idea behind my work is to advance educational design and deepen our understanding of learning, with a special focus on Computer Science education.
