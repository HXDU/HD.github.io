This is a new elective course I developed based on the book *Calling Bullshit: The Art of Skepticism in a Data-Driven World*, by Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West. The book, however, is only part of the course content. This course also covers other related topics such as AI ethics, prompt engineering, social network analysis, data visualization, and experiment design.
